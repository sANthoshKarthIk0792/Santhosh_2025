    "**Class**: In this context, the canvas and drawing operations are initialized and stored in a class. These are used to output the sprite sheet image and individual frames within the sprite sheet.\n",

    "  - **draw() method**: Uses nested **for-loops** to iterate through the sprite sheet and draw each frame independently on the canvas. It calculates the source and destination coordinates for each frame, taking into account the header and padding."
