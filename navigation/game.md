<h1> These are my favorite games and why I like them</h1>
<h3> Pokemon: Violet</h3>

<p>I like Pokemon: Violet a lot because I like Pokemon a lot. I like being able to choose how to battle other people, and being able to become the best trainer in the world. I especially like the post-game raids, because you can play with other people to defeat strong pokemon</p>
<h3>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3>

<p>I like Tears of the Kingdom because of how open the game is, and how unlinear it is. Almost nothing in the game is locked behind progression, except for events in the story. I think that the puzzles, combat and abilities in the gameare good.</p>
<h3>Minecraft</h3>

<p>I like Minecraft for a lot of the reasons that I like Tears of the Kingdom, you can do pretty much whatever you want, but you can mod Minecraft to add more to it.</p>
<h3>Roblox</h3>

<p>I don't usually play Roblox that much, but I like how many different games they are. While individual games might not be that high quality, the many games make Roblox muchhhh better.</p> 
<h3>Persona 5: Royal</h3>

<p>I like Persona  5 because I like the story, the characters, and the battle system . It is a very linear game, but has a great story and has many different things you can do throughout the days that isn't just battling, such as working or hanging out with characaters.</p>
